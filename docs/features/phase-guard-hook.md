# phase-guard.sh — computational enforcement of the phase gate

> First feature to run under the `docs/features/` workflow introduced by ADR 0010 (PR #29).
> Friction in the create → gate → restore cycle is itself a finding worth recording here.

## Problem

ADR 0010 moved permission for a class of work out of the conversation and into a file's `phase`
frontmatter, so it survives a `/clear`. It stopped there deliberately: **the permission is
recorded, not enforced.** Nothing prevents a session from writing implementation code while
`phase: planning`. Both observability-judge rounds on PR #29 flagged this, and the ADR discloses
it as a consequence rather than hiding it.

This feature asks whether to close that gap with a `PreToolUse` hook, and if so, how.

## The objection this design must answer

ADR 0010 rejected the hook on one specific ground, quoted verbatim:

> Resolving "which feature file is active" is ambiguous during planning (`branch: none`), so the
> hook would have to fail open in exactly the phase it most needs to hold.

That is the crux. A design that cannot answer it should not be built — "we'll fail open when
unsure" reduces to a hook that is silent precisely when `phase: planning` is being violated, which
is worse than no hook because it *looks* like enforcement.

## Proposed design — branch-scoped permission (answers Q2, the crux)

ADR 0010's objection assumes the hook must first resolve *which* feature file is active, then read
that file's `phase`. Under that framing the objection is correct and fatal: at `branch: none` there
is no key to look the file up by.

**The framing is avoidable.** The hook never needs to attribute a write to a feature. It needs one
bit, and it is a different bit: *does the current branch carry implementation permission?* That
question has a definite answer on every branch, including during planning.

> **Deny a guarded write when the repo has at least one feature file with `phase: planning`, AND
> the current branch is not recorded as `branch:` by any feature file with `phase: implementation`.**

Why this holds in the phase the ADR says it cannot: the workflow **forbids branch creation during
planning**, and the gate transition is what creates the branch and records it. So a planning session
is *by construction* sitting on a branch no feature file claims — `main`, or a worktree-isolation
branch like this one. The absence of a claim is not ambiguity; it is the signal. The lookup runs
forward (branch → is it claimed?), never backward (write → which feature?).

| Repo state | Current branch | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| No `docs/features/` at all | any | **allow**, silently — answers Q5 |
| All files `review`, or `implementation` on other branches | any | **allow** |
| A file is `implementation` with `branch: B` | `B` | **allow** |
| A file is `planning` | branch unclaimed (`main`, worktree, hotfix) | **deny** |
| Feature A `implementation` on `bA`; feature B `planning` | `bA` | **allow** — B's planning must not revoke A's permission |

**Residual weakness, stated plainly:** the hook enforces permission at *branch* granularity, not
per-feature attribution. While on a claimed implementation branch `bA`, a session could write source
belonging to a different, still-planning feature and the hook would allow it. That is a real hole —
but it is far narrower than "fails open during the entire planning phase", and it is the honest
boundary of what a `PreToolUse` hook can know.

**Second-order cost:** after the gate opens, `main` still carries the feature file at
`phase: planning`, so source writes on `main` stay denied until the PR merges and `phase` advances.
Consistent with `git-guard.sh` already blocking app-code commits to `main`, but it also catches an
unrelated hotfix branch cut from `main`. A stale, abandoned `planning` file locks the repo the same
way — the deny message must therefore name the offending file(s) so the fix is obvious.

## Open questions — resolutions

1. **Has the trigger condition actually been met?** ADR 0010 says build this "when the gate is
   observed being skipped, not before" (the `spec-guard` precedent). No skipped phase gate has been
   observed to date. Building now overrides the ADR's own stated deferral rule — a legitimate
   choice, but it must be a deliberate one, and it amends ADR 0010 rather than merely extending it.
   → **Deliberately deferred to the gate decision** (user, this session). Planning proceeds so the
   build/defer call is made against a real design rather than against an unknown.
2. **How does the hook identify the active feature file?** → **Resolved: it does not.** See the
   design above. The four candidates previously listed (`branch:` reverse-lookup, machine-local
   pointer, "exactly one non-`review` file", most-recently-modified) all inherit the wrong framing;
   each tries to name the active feature. Branch-scoped permission sidesteps all four. **Pending
   user acceptance** — this is a proposal, not a settled decision.
3. **Fail open or fail closed on ambiguity?** → **Resolved: fail closed *within scope*, and the
   scope is delimited by the existence of `docs/features/`.** A repo with no feature files is out of
   scope and allowed silently, which is what makes Q5 answerable at all.
   **But the fail-mode on *infrastructure* failure must diverge from `judge-guard.sh`, deliberately.**
   `judge-guard` fails closed when python is missing or the repo can't be resolved; it guards one
   rare command, so a false block costs a single retry. This hook fires on **every write in every
   repo** — a false block costs the whole session, in repos that never opted in. Blast radius, not
   inconsistency, drives the split: **fail closed only once a `planning` file is positively
   identified; fail open on inability to resolve git root, python, or frontmatter.**
4. **What exactly is a guarded write?** `Edit`/`Write`/`NotebookEdit` whose `file_path` is a source
   path, excluding `docs/**`, the feature file itself, and machine-local `.claude/**`. The
   source/doc split already exists at `hooks/doc-guard.sh:149` (`CODING_MEMORY.md`,
   `coding-memory/*`, `docs/*`) and should be reused, not re-invented. → **Carried as specified.**
   One addition the spec must handle: the payload's `file_path` is absolute, so it needs
   relativizing against `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` before that classification applies.
5. **Multi-repo behavior.** These hooks are global (`~/.claude/hooks/`) and fire in every repo.
   Most repos have no `docs/features/` at all. Absence must be unambiguously "not applicable",
   never "blocked". → **Resolved by row 1 of the table**, and it must be the hook's *first* check:
   one `stat` on `docs/features/`, exit 0, before any parsing. This path runs on every write.
6. **Does it supersede or complement the escape hatch pattern?** Both existing guards carry a
   logged env-var bypass (`JUDGE_EXEMPT`, `MERGE_EXEMPT`). Consistency argues for `PHASE_EXEMPT`.
   → **The pattern does not transfer, and this is a genuine finding.** `JUDGE_EXEMPT` works because
   it is an inline env-assignment on a *Bash command line* the hook parses out of the payload. An
   `Edit`/`Write` payload has no command-line surface to carry one. The remaining options are a
   session-wide exported `PHASE_EXEMPT` (far blunter — no per-write reason to log), a sentinel file,
   or **no bypass at all**, on the grounds that the honest way to earn write permission is to open
   the gate. Needs a decision; it is a spec-shaping one, not an implementation detail.

### New question raised by this design

7. **Does the hook enforce the reverse direction too?** The phase rules say implementation forbids
   spec and checklist edits. Enforcing that means denying edits to a feature file's Spec/Tasks
   sections while on a claimed implementation branch — which requires reasoning about *which section*
   of a markdown file an `Edit` touches, from `old_string`/`new_string`. Fragile. Recommend
   **out of scope**; the forward direction is where the value is.

## Prior art in this repo (read before designing — do not re-derive)

| File | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| `hooks/judge-guard.sh` | Fail-closed safety gate; `PreToolUse`, python payload parsing, strict-equality freshness check, logged env bypass. The closest structural sibling. |
| `hooks/doc-guard.sh` | Fail-open momentum guardrail; owns the source-vs-docs path classification this hook should reuse (`:149`). |
| `hooks/git-guard.sh` | The inline-regex parser trap documented in both files — regexes live in variables, never inline in `[[ ]]`. |
| `docs/decisions/0010-*.md` | The deferral being revisited, and its four rejected alternatives. |

## Spec

<Not yet written. Blocked on open questions 1–3, which are user decisions, not derivable from the
codebase. `writing-specs` governs the form once they are settled; the compliance judge gates it
before the user review.>

## Tasks

- [ ] <Not yet built. The checklist is written during planning and frozen at the gate; adding
      tasks after the gate opens is forbidden by the phase rules.>

## Verification

<Appended during review.>

## Notes for the next session

- Created in an isolated worktree (`.claude/worktrees/phase-guard-hook`, branch
  `worktree-phase-guard-hook`) because a **concurrent Claude session** was mid-rebase on
  `feat/pane-split-policy` in the primary checkout. That branch exists for parallel-session
  isolation only — it is **not** this feature's implementation branch, and `branch:` stays `none`
  until the gate opens.
- Unrelated loose end in the primary checkout: four `coding-memory/compliance-judge/*` files
  (other sessions' shared-store writes) were dropped from the working tree by that session's
  branch switch. Byte-verified backups are in this session's scratchpad under
  `other-session-files/`. They belong on `main`, not here.
