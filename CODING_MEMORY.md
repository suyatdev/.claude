## Active Session
- session_origin: desktop · session_started_at: 2026-07-20 (2nd session) · last_active_branch: feature/add-claude-code-handoff
- current work: **claude-code-handoff vendored install — COMMITTED, awaiting user cherry-pick.**
  Full verbatim install of github.com/Sonovore/claude-code-handoff @ c6cb717 (user chose full
  install over adapt-into-existing; model gate: Fable 5). `/handoff` command + 6 scripts under
  `hooks/handoff/` + 4 hook registrations (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, PostToolUse,
  PreCompact). Comparison chart delivered (link in branch log); user cherry-picks per-feature
  defaults next — nothing disabled yet, both memory systems currently run. settings.json
  committed as HEAD+handoff-only via index staging (Orca hooks + fable-model change stay
  uncommitted, policy unchanged). Detail: `coding-memory/branches/add-claude-code-handoff.md`.
- parked: **judge terminal-enforcement — design complete (§1–§4 approved), spec phase not
  started.** Resume via Next Steps 0b; full design + approvals:
  `coding-memory/brainstorms/2026-07-20-judge-terminal-enforcement.md`.
- **Session-budget preference (2026-07-20): keep each session below ~100k tokens; checkpoint memory
  after each task so the user can /clear before the next design task.**
- Carried over, still open: **Orca hooks in `settings.json` deliberately uncommitted** (third-party,
  machine-local, absolute paths; user's call pending; `claude-hook.sh` sources
  `$ORCA_AGENT_HOOK_ENDPOINT` before its token check and that stdout becomes hook stdout — a channel
  into the agent control plane). Untracked `chrome/`, `telemetry/`, `stats-cache.json` stay untracked
  (machine-local; tree permanently dirty so the status line always shows `✗`; gitignore an open
  question for the user).
- 2026-07-19 session notes — statusline-edit authorship resolved as that session's own work,
  concurrent-session evidence, model-gate history (Sonnet 5 → Opus 4.8), `chore(settings):`
  precedent for model/theme changes: `coding-memory/branches/statusline-token-bar.md` and
  `coding-memory/session-log.md`.

- PR #9 (feature/rules-to-skills-restructure) — MERGED 2026-07-15 (fast-forward, user's choice to
  merge locally rather than wait for GitHub review). Branch deleted. The rules-to-skills
  restructure: 7 always-loaded rule files → core-conduct.md + gates.md + 5 new skills + git-guard
  hook. Always-on content: 4,030 → 1,151 words (~71% cut).
- feature/documentation-enforcement (2026-07-16) — documentation-enforcement backstop:
  `hooks/doc-guard.sh` (block substantial undocumented source commits + surface uncommitted
  work before compaction / at next session start), broadened `managing-session-memory` criteria
  (business-logic + direction-pivoting changes → mandatory + ADR), ADR standard/template in
  `setting-up-a-new-project`, gates stub. Verified (15-case harness). **PR #10 MERGED (2026-07-16).**
  Detail: `coding-memory/branches/documentation-enforcement.md`.
- PR #11 (chore/ports-registry-snatch-8001) — MERGED 2026-07-16. Reconciled the orphaned PORTS.md
  edit (snatch-bracket backend on port 8001) as its own commit, per user's commit-only-my-work call.

  (Mermaid docs standard: SKILL.md + references/assets/scripts validator; Mermaid-not-PlantUML).
  Detail: `coding-memory/branches/diagramming-skill.md`.
- feature/observability-judge (2026-07-16) — the observability judge (16 commits, 17/17 tests):
  scoring subagent (10 dims → JSONL+markdown verdict + layman summary), `hooks/judge-guard.sh`
  blocking `gh pr create` without a fresh strict-freshness verdict, skill + gate stub + catalog,
  ADR 0001, spec, verdict store. Command detection took 2 review-driven security fixes
  (substring→anchored→python shlex, closing a quoted-env-prefix bypass). **PR #13 MERGED
  2026-07-17** (bootstrap self-gate → JUDGE_EXEMPT).
  Detail: `coding-memory/branches/observability-judge.md`; PR status: `coding-memory/pr-tracking.md`.
- feature/memory-rag-index (2026-07-17→18) — `memsearch`: local SQLite (sqlite-vec + FTS5) RAG over
  transcripts + curated docs, Qwen3 embeddings, hybrid retrieval, silent SessionStart nudge.
  60-test suite green, backfill 228 sources / 2332 chunks / 0 errors / p95 149ms, golden 16/16.
  **PR #14 MERGED 2026-07-18** (7015369). Judge (impl): risk=low conf=high, outcome=clean.
  Detail: `coding-memory/branches/memory-rag-index.md`.
- feature/compliance-judge (2026-07-18) — subagent judging ONE finished spec against live rules
  (writing-specs + core-conduct/security): blocking pass/fail, per-rule citations, JSONL+markdown
  store; skill with parallel dispatch alongside the observability judge, capped auto-revise loop,
  escalation, explicit-only waivers; gates stub + catalog, ADR 0003, golden eval 12/12.
  **PR #16 MERGED 2026-07-18** (4c2abec). Judge (impl @ 85d8982): risk=low conf=high, clean.
  Detail: `coding-memory/branches/compliance-judge.md`.
- feature/writing-project-readmes-skill (2026-07-19) — `writing-project-readmes` skill: house
  README standard from the user-supplied template (check-then-create, real facts only, `[TODO:]`
  greppable placeholders) + Roadmap upkeep as features land + trigger wiring (setting-up-a-new-
  project step 5, preparing-pull-requests bullet, CLAUDE.md catalog). TDD RED/GREEN + 8/8 routing.
  **PR #17 MERGED 2026-07-19** (merge commit d242e69); branch deleted. Judge rounds 1-2
  (3c5a826 low/medium → grep hole fixed → 0d23feb low/high), outcome=clean (backfilled).
  Detail: `coding-memory/branches/writing-project-readmes-skill.md`.
- feature/statusline-command (2026-07-19) — Claude Code status line reproducing the oh-my-zsh
  `robbyrussell` prompt (`➜ user@host dir git:(branch) ✗`) plus dimmed model + token-count
  segments: new `statusline-command.sh`, `statusLine` entry in `settings.json`, README table
  row; model → opus[1m] and theme → dark split into their own `chore(settings)` commit.
  Observability judge ran **5 rounds**, each finding something real in the round before: terminal-escape
  injection via four distinct paths (incl. a **second** unstripped fallback introduced by the fix for the
  third), false "pushed" claims, and an unverified `context_window` schema — all fixed. Test suite
  validated by falsification against all 5 historical versions rather than by passing alone
  (`statusline-command.falsify.py` makes that reproducible). Recurring lesson: **the write-up ran ahead
  of the code in every round**, including a "Cosmetic, no leak" claim about a path that did leak. Scope
  overran badly — 5 of 6 commits judge-driven; taken to the user rather than resolved unilaterally.
  No ADR (presentation-only — misses all three ADR triggers).
  Detail: `coding-memory/branches/statusline-command.md`.
- feature/statusline-token-bar (2026-07-19) — **PR #20 MERGED 2026-07-20 04:01Z.** Follow-on
  to PR #18: model name orange, context bar scaled to a fixed 100k "time to clear" reference (not the
  model's window — against 1M a 143k session rendered nearly-empty-but-red), cumulative Σ counting
  input+output only (cache traffic swamped it ~16x), purple weekly-quota segment. A cost-estimate
  feature was requested, built, then **removed entirely**: subscription plan, `costUSD: 0`, no cost
  field in the payload — any dollar figure would have been invented. Weekly quota is a percentage
  for the same reason: docs confirm `rate_limits` exposes `used_percentage` + `resets_at` only, so
  "tokens left" is uncomputable. Schema check caught a silent bug: `resets_at` is epoch seconds, not
  ISO — the countdown would have never rendered and looked merely absent.
  Judge R1 (b24d422) risk=**high**; all three findings fixed across 4 commits (fc67ab1 tests,
  888449e race repro RED, d7a2861 lock GREEN + ADR 0005, d302479 lock-recovery tests).
  Recurring lesson, now three-for-three on this branch: **writing the check is not the same as the
  check working.** The first lock regression test planted its PID file with a trailing newline —
  a condition the buggy writer cannot produce — so re-introducing the bug passed 44/44. Only the
  mutation revealed it. Every claim on this branch is now falsification-backed.
  Detail: `coding-memory/branches/statusline-token-bar.md`, ADR 0005.
- feature/verifying-subagent-commits (2026-07-18) — new skill: after a dispatched implementer/fix
  subagent reports DONE with a commit SHA, the controller independently confirms via `git log -1`
  in the target checkout that it actually landed there, before trusting the report. Harvested from
  a real trace (a subagent committed to the wrong checkout 3x in one session, despite an explicit
  dispatch-prompt self-check instruction). Not hook-enforced by design. **PR #15 MERGED
  2026-07-18** (merge commit 417e8e7); branch deleted. Judge (impl, head 367da77): risk=low
  conf=high, outcome=clean.
- feature/add-claude-code-handoff (2026-07-20) — vendored Sonovore/claude-code-handoff @
  c6cb717 verbatim (user's call): `/handoff` command, `hooks/handoff/` scripts, 4 hook
  registrations, nested `.claude/` gitignored. Both memory systems live pending per-feature
  cherry-pick (comparison chart sent). Judge + PR deferred until after the cherry-pick.
  Detail: `coding-memory/branches/add-claude-code-handoff.md`.

## Exact Next Steps
0. **claude-code-handoff cherry-pick (2026-07-20) — AWAITING USER PICKS.** Comparison chart
   delivered (artifact e570411a-795d-4b79-bda2-d0017ad9794e; content regenerable from
   `coding-memory/branches/add-claude-code-handoff.md`). On reply: disable losing hook
   registrations in settings.json, adapt winners (standouts: bug-test-log ledger,
   recent-prompts capture, forward-looking handoff principle), per-repo gitignore guidance,
   observability judge, then PR (judge deferred to PR time by design). Known upstream bug:
   PostToolUse tracker no-ops when live-handoff created session-state.md.
0b. **Judge terminal-enforcement (2026-07-20) — parked. Design COMPLETE (§1–§4 approved).**
   Next: **spec phase on Opus 4.8** (model gate answered 2026-07-20 — prompt `/model` if not
   on it) → new branch off `main` (proposed `feature/judge-terminal-enforcement`,
   NOT off statusline branch) → spec doc → self-review → compliance + observability judges
   (current skill procedure — spec-guard doesn't exist yet) → user review → writing-plans.
   Branch `feature/judge-terminal-enforcement` cut off `main` 2026-07-20. The write-up now lives
   on `main`, so the branch inherits it; the spec should still stand alone as the build artifact.
   Approved design + platform facts (hook timeout **fails open**; `claude --bare -p --agent`):
   `coding-memory/brainstorms/2026-07-20-judge-terminal-enforcement.md`.
1. **Statusline token bar — RESOLVED: PR #20 merged 2026-07-20 04:01Z.** (Memory had said "not yet
   PR'd"; reconciled 2026-07-20 — the merge happened outside a checkpointed session, and the 3
   brainstorm commits pushed afterwards were stranded until the docs-only merge above.) R5 was
   never run and is now moot. Still open, deliberately unabsorbed: R1's `STATUSLINE_DEBUG` logging
   to `$STATE_DIR/debug.log` splitting "field absent" from "field present but unparseable" — the
   judge noted it would have caught the epoch-seconds bug on render one. Cosmetics left: duration
   floors, bar rounds full at 95k, no MB rollover. Lessons (same bug class one level deeper each
   round; `mkdir`-atomic over `mv`; verify a break against whatever justified it) are recorded in
   `coding-memory/branches/statusline-token-bar.md` and ADR 0005.
2. **compliance-judge (post-merge reconcile DONE 2026-07-18):** remaining loose end only —
   the store is global but writeup filenames carry no repo component (final-review
   recommendation); revisit if cross-repo spec slugs ever collide. Also: backfill the
   compliance-judge verdicts' own `outcome` fields once those specs implement (calibration
   ledger, see running-the-compliance-judge SKILL.md).
3. **memsearch debt (recorded, not blocking; ledger `.superpowers/sdd/progress.md` has detail):**
   `index` exits 0 even when errors>0 (fix before wiring automation to exit codes); validate
   `ollama_url` is loopback; busy_timeout PRAGMA; fail-fast on Ollama-down backfill; `--since`
   format validation; README sentence that digest-chunk line numbers are digest-relative.
   Memsearch-nudge SessionStart line: **VERIFIED live 2026-07-18** (fired post-/clear, 2332 chunks).
4. **Live-verify** doc-guard's PreCompact injection against a real `/compact` — still pending.
   SessionStart injection **VERIFIED live 2026-07-18**: post-/clear it surfaced the uncommitted
   verdict-store + settings.json changes exactly as designed (15-case harness had covered logic only).
5. (Optional) Retire `coding-memory/decisions.md` in favour of `docs/decisions/` (now ADRs
   0001-**0005**) — the "adopt" framing was stale, the directory was never the blocker.
   Diagramming-pointers half **DONE 2026-07-19** (PR #19), wider than this item scoped it.
5a. **Watch the next 2-3 `coding-memory/` branch logs** (ADR-0004 revisit trigger). If one lands with
   real structure and no diagram, move the `managing-session-memory:18` pointer from the
   index-description bullet into the save-time procedure section. Escalation if that also fails is a
   **gate stub, never the hook** (the hook's rejection is structural; the gate's is cost/benefit).
   Evidence: **2 of 3** — `diagramming-pointers.md` has a flowchart; `statusline-token-bar.md` now
   describes a lock protocol with real structure and carries **none** (its diagram went to ADR 0005).
   The 07-20 brainstorm write-up carries its flowchart inline (counts toward the healthy side).
6. (Optional) Backfill `outcome` for the remaining `null` verdicts (all known-clean):
   `feature/observability-judge` @ fdbd7b9 and @ 381bd79, memsearch *architecting* @ c2b23fe.
   See `coding-memory/observability-judge/verdicts.jsonl`.

**Merged** (full detail: `coding-memory/pr-tracking.md`): `.claude` PRs #10–#16 (07-16→18) —
documentation-enforcement, PORTS.md reconcile, diagramming skill, observability judge (+ judge-guard
hook, live and global), memsearch RAG index, verifying-subagent-commits, compliance judge; plus
vibe-scape (Tayvyx-Lab/VibeSpace) PRs #6–#7. **07-19:** #17 (writing-project-readmes, d242e69),
#18 (statusline, b6362ff). **07-20:** #19 (diagramming reachability + ADR 0004, a735fb4),
**#20 (statusline token bar, merged 04:01Z)**.

**Orphans outstanding:** branches `feature/statusline-command`, `docs/diagramming-pointers`, and
now `feature/statusline-token-bar` are merged but not deleted (local + remote). Also unmerged and
unexplained by memory: remote branches `feature/documentation-enforcement`,
`feature/modular-coding-memory`, `feature/vibe-coding-standards-integration`,
`update/update-default-model` — their PRs merged long ago; safe to prune after a check.
