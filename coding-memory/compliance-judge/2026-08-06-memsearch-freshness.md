### Layman summary

The diagnosis in this spec is excellent and I could not break it. I re-ran the measurements:
`status.json` really does read `last_indexed: 2026-07-18T06:18:01+00:00` while `memory.db` was
touched today, so the "file mtime doesn't track indexing" trap is real and correctly called out —
a refresh trigger keyed on mtime genuinely would never fire. The `+00:00` format really does parse
under the pinned Python 3.9.6 where a `Z` would not. bash 3.2.57, no `timeout` on PATH, `plutil` at
`/usr/bin/plutil` — all confirmed. The core insight, that the reporting half is what makes the
scheduling half honest, is the right architecture, and the scope discipline (stopping at parent
item 5, excluding item 6 because it rests on a result not yet obtained) is exemplary. Nothing here
is speculative; there is no YAGNI problem.

The nudge half — R1 through R3 — is close to build-ready. Seven Gherkin scenarios, an exact
one-line output for each of the three states, explicit handling for a missing, unparseable, or
future-dated timestamp, and a "fail toward doubt" rule that never claims freshness it can't prove.
That is the part of the spec doing real work.

**The launchd half is where this fails, and it fails in the same shape as the bug it is fixing.**

The most important finding is concrete and mechanical. `memsearch/bin/install-schedule` will
install a job that runs `memsearch index`, but `memsearch/bin/memsearch` is a one-line wrapper
whose entire body is `exec uv run --project "$HOME/.claude/memsearch" ...`. On this machine `uv`
lives at `/opt/homebrew/bin/uv`. `launchctl getenv PATH` returns empty, so the job inherits
launchd's default `/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin` — and `uv` is not in any of those four
directories. I checked. The spec's plist contract lists `StartInterval`, `RunAtLoad`,
`StandardOutPath`/`StandardErrorPath`, the `__HOME__` placeholder and a `plutil -lint` gate, but it
never names `ProgramArguments`, `Label`, or an `EnvironmentVariables` PATH. So an implementer
follows the contract exactly, the install reports success, and the job dies at exec with status 127
every six hours forever. The stale line would eventually surface it — which is the design working —
but shipping a scheduler that has never once run is not the intent, and one line of contract
prevents it.

The second finding is the install script's error handling. The spec is admirably explicit that a
`plutil -lint` failure means refuse-and-fail-closed, and that `bootout` should ignore "not found"
for idempotency. But `launchctl bootstrap` — the single call that determines whether the scheduler
exists at all — has no stated failure behaviour, and neither does a missing `~/Library/LaunchAgents`
directory, an unwritable render target, or the script's own exit code. `bootstrap` fails routinely
and noisily in practice (domain errors, an already-loaded label, a plist mode launchd rejects). As
written, a failed install is indistinguishable from a successful one.

The rest are smaller but each would force an implementer to guess: no scenarios at all for R4–R7
(every scenario covers the nudge, none covers the half with system-level side effects); `uv` missing
from the pinned toolchain table despite being the runtime the scheduled job actually executes;
R7's acceptance bar counting "hits from the named feature's own documents" without saying what
makes a document belong to a feature; and a log file specified only as "a log under
`~/.claude/memory-index/`" — a directory that already holds an unexplained zero-byte `reindex.log`.

One thing I want to record as *passing*, because the request asked: **the falsifier is genuinely
falsifiable.** Clauses (a), (b) and (e) are mechanically hook-testable, (d) is checkable from git
history precisely because the queries commit first, and (c) is observational but has a defined
threshold. It is not a fake falsifier and it should survive the revision unchanged.

### Violations

| # | id | rule_source | rule | where | why |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `writing-specs/api-contracts` | `skills/writing-specs/SKILL.md` | API contracts give the agent real interface boundaries instead of letting it improvise shapes | Contracts → `memsearch/launchd/local.memsearch-index.plist.template` | The plist contract omits `Label`, `ProgramArguments` and any `EnvironmentVariables` PATH, so the command line must be invented — and the obvious rendering fails at exec because `memsearch` execs `uv` from `/opt/homebrew/bin`, absent from launchd's default PATH. |
| 2 | `core-conduct/explicit-error-handling` | `rules/core-conduct.md` | Handle errors explicitly, never swallow them; fail closed on any validation failure | Contracts → `memsearch/bin/install-schedule` | Only `plutil -lint` failure has stated behaviour, while `launchctl bootstrap` failure — the boundary deciding whether the scheduler exists at all — plus a missing `~/Library/LaunchAgents`, an unwritable target and the script's own exit codes are unspecified, so a failed install can report success. |
| 3 | `writing-specs/edge-cases` | `skills/writing-specs/SKILL.md` | State what correct looks like, what wrong looks like, and enumerate the edges | Scenarios | All seven scenarios exercise the nudge (R1–R3); R4–R7 — install idempotency, the fail-closed lint refusal, a bootstrap failure, the golden-query change, the retrieval bar — have no scenario at all, and that is the half with system-level side effects. |
| 4 | `writing-specs/pinned-versions` | `skills/writing-specs/SKILL.md` | Pin the exact version of every library and tool | Toolchain — pinned | `uv`, the runtime the scheduled job actually executes (`memsearch/bin/memsearch` is a one-line `exec uv run --project` wrapper), is absent from the table entirely, and `sqlite3` is listed as `system` with no version. |
| 5 | `gates/adr-required` | `rules/gates.md` | ADRs under `docs/decisions/` remain required for structural and direction-pivoting decisions | Design decisions (3) / Tasks | Adopting a persistent `launchd` daemon as the scheduling mechanism is structural, and the spec overturns two parent-spec items on new evidence, yet none of the nine tasks writes an ADR — in a repo whose 17 existing ADRs sit at finer granularity than this (0002 sqlite-over-qdrant, 0014 empty-index). |
| 6 | `writing-specs/ambiguous-acceptance-bar` | `skills/writing-specs/SKILL.md` | Requirements the agent can satisfy and you can check; no requirement readable two ways | Requirements → R7 | "≥2 hits from the named feature's own documents" and "top hit from that feature" give no membership rule for what counts as a feature's own document (path prefix? ADRs? hooks?), so task 8's pass/fail becomes a judgment call rather than a measurement. |
| 7 | `writing-specs/ambiguous-log-path` | `skills/writing-specs/SKILL.md` | No placeholders or requirements readable two ways | Contracts → plist template (`StandardOutPath`/`StandardErrorPath`) | The log is specified only as "a log under `~/.claude/memory-index/`" with no filename, and that directory already contains an unexplained zero-byte `reindex.log`, so an implementer cannot tell whether to reuse it or create a new one. |

### Notes (non-blocking)

- **Falsifier passes.** (a), (b), (e) are mechanically hook-testable; (d) is git-checkable and is
  the reason committing the queries first is load-bearing; (c) is observational with a defined
  threshold. Genuinely falsifiable — keep it as written.
- **Boundary validation on `last_indexed` is well specified** — absent, unparseable, and negative
  age all route to unknown-age and never to fresh, and the exact output wording never echoes the
  raw field, so there is no injection path into the emitted line. Right posture.
- Diagnostic claims verified live: `status.json` reads `last_indexed 2026-07-18T06:18:01+00:00`
  with 228 sources / 2332 chunks; `memory.db` mtime is today against a Jul 18 index, confirming the
  mtime trap; the SQL `_`-wildcard warning is correct; `datetime.fromisoformat` under 3.9.6 parses
  `+00:00` but not `Z`, as stated.
- Toolchain claims verified: bash 3.2.57(1)-release arm64-apple-darwin25, python3 3.9.6, no
  `timeout` binary on PATH, `plutil` present at `/usr/bin/plutil`.
- **Not cited — file modes.** No mode is stated for the rendered plist (launchd refuses a
  group/world-writable plist, so this is functional, not just hygiene) or for the new log, and the
  log appends forever with no rotation stated.
- **Not cited — zero-trust.** Task 7 has an implementing agent install a persistent background
  daemon into the user's login session with no stated confirmation step; core-conduct wants
  destructive/autonomous actions summarised in plain English first. Held as a note because the
  human spec-review gate arguably supplies that consent.
- **Not cited — spec location.** `writing-specs` defers to `docs/superpowers/specs/`, but the repo
  layer (`rules/gates.md` one-canonical-file discipline) mandates `docs/features/<name>.md` for
  feature-scale work, and project rules win on conflict. Same reasoning as the `memory-system-split`
  rounds.
- **YAGNI is clean.** Scope explicitly ends at parent item 5; item 6 is excluded with a stated
  reason; the four non-goals are named. No speculative surface.
- Incidental: `memory.db` is now ~42 MB against `status.json`'s recorded `db_bytes` of ~17.5 MB —
  `query_log` growth since July. Out of scope here, but the scheduler will make `db_bytes`
  meaningful again, and unbounded `query_log` growth may deserve its own item later.
