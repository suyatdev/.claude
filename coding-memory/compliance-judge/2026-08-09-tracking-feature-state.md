## Round 1 — 2026-08-09T07:13:40Z — **FAIL** (7 violations)

### Summary in plain language

This spec is unusually well-built in the places that normally rot. The background actually argues
*why* the feature exists, the "write claims as derivations, not stored numbers" discipline is real
and holding, and the one thing that burned two prior audits — the difference between a cmux
behaviour *documented* for `rename-tab` and the same behaviour merely *assumed* for `send` — is
handled exactly right: the spec keeps them separate, calls the `send` case unproven, and writes
criterion 9 so the requirement holds no matter which way the probe lands. None of that is cited
against.

What fails is concentrated in one place: **the part of the system that isn't built yet.** The
control server is the component this spec itself calls load-bearing, and it is the component with
no contract. Nobody has written down its URL, its request or response shape, the name of the
"custom request header" that is supposed to force a preflight, or whether an allowlisted command
can carry an argument. Task 10 has to connect the browser UI to that server, so two halves of the
feature are being asked to agree on a shape that was never written down — and "can a command carry
an argument" is not a cosmetic gap, because an argument is untrusted text flowing into a Claude
session that holds full tool permissions.

The sharpest finding is the token. The spec's plan is to bake a per-launch bearer token into
`task-tracker/tracker-data.js` — and that file is **tracked in git** today
(`git ls-files task-tracker/` lists it) with nothing in `.gitignore` covering it. The spec states no
file mode, no git exclusion and no scrub. The single credential guarding the new HTTP hop is
therefore scheduled to be written into a committed, world-readable file. The Security section's own
argument — "the socket was already reachable, what's new is the HTTP hop, so every bullet must
defend that hop" — is correct, and this is the bullet that currently doesn't.

Two smaller mechanical ones: the spec hardcodes `/Users/marksuyat/...` into a committed file, and
every tool it depends on (`pytest`, `uv`, `cmux`, Python itself) is unpinned — which is also why
the recorded "53 passed" can't be reproduced on demand.

**Not cited, deliberately:** the spec's location in `docs/features/` is *correct* here — this repo's
own One-canonical-file discipline in `rules/gates.md` overrides the global `docs/superpowers/specs/`
default, and project rules win. The `tracker-data` schema is likewise judged as conformance to an
existing external contract, not as under-designed new API.

### Violations

| # | id | rule source | rule | where | why |
|---|----|-------------|------|-------|-----|
| 1 | `core-conduct/secrets-not-client-side` | `rules/core-conduct.md` | Zero-Trust: nothing sensitive lives client-side; no secrets in committed files; default-deny every generated data store | §Security → "Per-launch bearer token" | The token is baked into `task-tracker/tracker-data.js`, which is git-tracked with no `.gitignore` entry, and the spec sets no file mode, git exclusion or scrub — putting the HTTP hop's only credential in a committed file. |
| 2 | `writing-specs/api-contracts` | `skills/writing-specs/SKILL.md` | "Database schemas and API contracts … give the agent the real interface boundaries instead of letting it improvise shapes that other components then fail to match" | §Design → "3. Control server"; §Security | No endpoint path, method, request/response schema, header name, token field name, status codes beyond 403, error body, or whether a command id carries an argument — yet task 10 must wire the UI to it and an argument would be untrusted text entering a full-permission session. |
| 3 | `writing-specs/pinned-versions` | `skills/writing-specs/SKILL.md` | "Pin the exact version of every library and tool" | §Verification; §Tasks 3–13 | `pytest`, `uv`, `cmux` and the Python interpreter are all named unversioned (only the vendored UI is pinned at `v0.4.1`), so `uv run --with pytest` resolves whatever PyPI serves that day and the collection/`addopts` behaviour the spec depends on can shift underneath it. |
| 4 | `core-conduct/explicit-error-handling` | `rules/core-conduct.md` | Code Style: "Handle errors explicitly, never swallow them. Validate all input at system boundaries." | §Design → 1 Analyzer, 3 Control server; criterion 9 | No stated behaviour when the target isn't a git repo, when `git worktree list`/`rev-list` fails or a branch has no upstream, when frontmatter is malformed, or when `cmux send` exits non-zero or hangs; criterion 9 says the server "refuses and reports" without saying what it returns. |
| 5 | `core-conduct/no-absolute-paths` | `rules/core-conduct.md` | Zero-Trust: "no secrets or absolute paths in committed files" | §"The output contract already exists" | The spec hardcodes `/Users/marksuyat/Other\ Docs/AI/AI_Projx/Task Progress Analysis UI` into a git-tracked file, embedding a machine- and user-specific path in version control. |
| 6 | `writing-specs/no-placeholders` | `skills/writing-specs/SKILL.md` | A spec must leave nothing to guess at — no placeholders or requirements readable two ways | §Security → "Allowlisted commands only" | The allowlist is written as "(`clear`, `handoff`, `reanalyze`, …)", so the ellipsis hands the completion of the entire authorization set to the implementer. |
| 7 | `writing-specs/diagrams` | `skills/writing-specs/SKILL.md` | "Diagrams and the required toolchain: include visual aids … Draw the visual aids as rendered Mermaid" | whole document | A four-component design that crosses browser → localhost HTTP → cmux socket → full-permission Claude session carries no rendered Mermaid, so the trust boundary a reader most needs to see is prose-only. (Lowest severity of the seven.) |

### Notes (non-blocking)

- **Gherkin shape:** 8 of 9 acceptance criteria collapse `When` into `Given` (only criterion 1 has
  all three clauses). Intent stays unambiguous and the skill's own token-economy warning partly
  excuses it, so this is not cited — but restoring the trigger clause would make each criterion
  translate directly into a test name.
- **YAGNI, human-owned:** the stated need (know the merge order across cards and worktrees) is fully
  served by components 1, 2 and 4. Component 3, the control server, is where all the risk lives.
  The control channel is inside the scope as given, so this is not a violation — but "ship the
  read-only survey first, gate the control channel separately" is a scope call worth putting to the
  user once rather than deciding silently.
- **File size:** `analyze.py` is over the 400-line target and under the 800 max; the spec names the
  split (`git_facts.py`) and correctly defers it as human-owned — compliant. Worth watching that
  `server.py` (task 8) carries bind + token + allowlist + header check + surface re-resolution +
  subprocess and will land near the same target.
- **Handled correctly, for the record:** the `rename-tab`-documented vs. `send`-assumed fall-through
  distinction is preserved in both §"Injection route" and criterion 9, with the requirement written
  to hold either way. No citation.
- **Derivations discipline holds.** The one surviving stored number ("53 passed") is stamped with its
  date and its reproducing command and explicitly marked re-run-rather-than-trust — the right shape.
  Pinning pytest (violation 3) is what would make it actually reproducible.
- **Path is correct.** `docs/features/` beats the global `docs/superpowers/specs/` default via this
  repo's One-canonical-file discipline. Explicitly not a violation.

### Waivers

None. No violation has ever been waived for this spec.
