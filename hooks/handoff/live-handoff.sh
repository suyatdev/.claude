# Vendored from https://github.com/Sonovore/claude-code-handoff @ c6cb717 (2026-07-20)
# Locally patched 2026-07-20: INIT template gained the "<!-- Files touched this session -->"
# marker so the PostToolUse tracker's sed target exists (upstream bug: the tracker silently
# no-ops whenever this template wins the file-creation race against proactive-handoff.sh init).
# Live Handoff — UserPromptSubmit hook
# Injects a directive on EVERY user message telling Claude to maintain session-state.md
# This is the primary mechanism for continuous context preservation.
#
# How it works:
#   - Fires before Claude processes each user message
#   - Outputs a <live-handoff> directive into Claude's system context
#   - Claude sees this directive and updates .claude/session-state.md as needed
#   - When session-state.md grows too large, the directive switches to "rewrite" mode
#
# Install: place in .claude/hooks/ and add UserPromptSubmit to .claude/settings.json

REQUIRED: Before responding, update .claude/session-state.md:
1. Read the current file
2. It has grown too large. Rewrite it keeping ONLY the most critical information:
   - Active decisions and their rationale
   - Key context that would be lost if early conversation is compressed
   - Current focus and immediate next steps
   - Important file locations and what changed
3. Remove anything that is: obvious from code, already committed, no longer relevant, or low-importance
4. Target: under ${TARGET_LINES} lines. Be ruthless — only keep what you'd need to continue this work cold.

REQUIRED: Before responding, check if anything important happened since session-state.md was last updated.
If yes — append to the appropriate section in .claude/session-state.md:
- Decisions made and why
- Architecture or approach changes
- Key discoveries or gotchas
- Important file:line references
- Changes to current focus or next steps
If nothing noteworthy happened (e.g. simple question, no new info), skip the update.
Do NOT rewrite the whole file — just append new items to existing sections.
